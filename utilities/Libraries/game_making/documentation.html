            <h4>So you want to make your own game, with coding, but you don't know much about coding?</h4>
            <h4>you search on internet to find a good game making library for js, that is simple enough</h4>
            <h4>or maybe ask a friend which introduces this game making library</h4>
            <br>
            <h4>And here we are introducing Electrame a simple Game Making<sup>2D</sup> library</h4>
            <h4>which can make games so simply, you just got to know javascript<sup>  a lil bit</sup> and</h4>
            <h4>you can start making your own game already! this library obviously, isn't as advanced as three<sup>js</sup></h4>
            <h4>cause its not supposed to be advanced, like the meaning of "simple game making library"</h4>
            <h4>is that the user can make its own game simply, and making it simple kinda have limitations</h4>
            <br>
            <h1 id="how">How does it work?</h1>
            <h4>So reading this part means you like our library, right? :D</h4>
            <h4>well our library uses a thing in html called canvas, which is sadly not supported in firefox</h4>
            <h4>canvas gives the programmers tools to make cool screens and stuff, but it might get annoying very soon</h4>
            <h4>for game making. here you understand what you write, which is technically possible if you make your game with functions</h4>
            <h4>but we did it for you so not needed, for example here you can just define a shape and pick a color</h4>
            <h4>or just put a rgb color yourself there, but we put a bunch of premade and useful colors there for you so yep</h4>
            <h4>and just merge those 2 things into a object, which will generate this informations with it too</h4>
            <h4>Position X, Position Y, Velocity X, Velocity Y, (Scale X, Scale Y) or Radius, Id, Shape, Cid</h4>
            <h4>Cid is the collision id, which for example an image has a collision id of a rectangle("Square" in the code)</h4>
            <h4>which you never ever need to touch unless you want your image to collide differently which happens rarely and others are obvious</h4>
            <h4>so how do we render stuff?</h4>
            <h4>we draw the frame, then after the next frame we delete the old frame and create a new one</h4>
            <h4>Note: our X and Y positioning and velocity system is, Increase X = to the right of the screen, Increase Y = to the bottom of the screen</h4>
            <br>
            <h1 id="install">Installation</h1>
            <h4>Just add this to your html code, also run the script inside or after the body!!!!</h4>
            <h3>&lt;script src="electrame.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</h3>
            <br>
            <h1 id="start">Getting Started PART 1</h1>
            <h4>So finally a new user wants to learn our library, AMAZING!</h4>
            <h4>So first of all! we need to tell the library to be prepared to work, so just put this command there, EInit()</h4>
            <h3>EInit();</h3>
            <h4>then we add the canvas to html like the normal way OR we use ECreateGame(id,width,height) which we gonna name the game: first</h4>
            <h4>and I think our game would be 600 by 300 so here it is</h4>
            <h3>ECreateGame("first", 600, 300);</h3>
            <h4>Then we can config if our world has gravity or friction</h4>
            <h3>let Gravity = false;
let Friction = true;
EConfig(Gravity,Friction);</h3>
            <h4>Then we can define our game! with EGame(id) which in this case is</h4>
            <h3>let Game = new EGame("first");</h3>
            <h4>Now we have our game! but we need a background right? first lets add the color of it, I am gonna go with bright blue<sup>Day color</sup></h4>
            <h4>so we can use EColors for premade stuff, so this is how it is EColors(opacity 1 to 0).color</h4>
            <h3>let Background = new EColors(1).DAY;</h3>
            <h4>You can check the materials tab for a full list of the colors you can also use RGB</h4>
            <h4>So the color is set, but for the shape, we all know our background is rectangle but sometimes you might use css to make your game screen circle</h4>
            <h4>but we not gonna do that now so lets define the shape of the background! we can use ESquare(width,height)</h4>
            <h3>let Background_Resolution = new ESquare(600,300);</h3>
            <h4>now lets define the object! (x,y,shape,material)</h4>
            <h3>let Sky = new EObject(0,0,Background_Resolution,Background);</h3>
            <h4>now we defined the background, you can try and define the ground yourself now too</h4>
            <h4>so after we defined everything we define a function and render everything! (Game, Object)</h4>
            <h3>function my_first_game() {
    ERender(Game,Sky);
}
my_first_game();</h3>
            <h4>current code:</h4>
            <h3>EInit();
ECreateGame("first", 600, 300);
let Gravity = false;
let Friction = true;
EConfig(Gravity,Friction);
let Game = new EGame("first");
let Background = new EColors(1).DAY;
let Background_Resolution = new ESquare(600,300);
let Sky = new EObject(0,0,Background_Resolution,Background);
function my_first_game() {
    ERender(Game,Sky);
}
my_first_game();</h3>
            <h4>so enough for part one!</h4>
            <br>
            <h1 id="starter">Getting Started PART 2</h1>
            <h4>Oooo hi again :D</h4>
            <h4>so in the last part we learned how to create an object and render it out!</h4>
            <h4>now we can code something just like this!</h4>
            <h3>EInit();
ECreateGame("first", 600, 300);
let Gravity = false;
let Friction = true;
EConfig(Gravity,Friction);

let Player_Shape = new ESquare(10,10);
let Player = new EObject(20,230,Player_Shape,Player_Color);
function my_first_game() {
    ERender(Game,Sky);
    ERender(Game,Ground);
    ERender(Game,Player);
}
my_first_game();</h3>
            <h4>So we have drawn a simple sky and a ground and the player on top of the ground</h4>
            <h4>I am gonna add some keys for the player to move, but before that we need to do a bit of physics stuff</h4>
            <h4>I am gonna also turn on the gravity since we have a ground cause thats how usually games work?</h4>
            <h4>But first off, our current thing is just a dead image, if we want to bring animation we have to loop it</h4>
            <h4>to loop it, we not gonna use for or while or something like that, we need a slow loop so like this</h4>
            <h4>we can setup a loop that runs every 10ms which is our frame rate speed! we can change fps that but we keep it like that for now</h4>
            <h3>function example() {
    setTimeout(() => {
        // your code goes here!
        example();
    }, 10);
}</h3>
            <h4>we also need to clear the screen every time we want to render again</h4>
            <h4>another command introduced! EClear()</h4>
            <h4>So if we implement the same thing we used in this and the other example and enable gravity we get this:</h4>
            <h3>EInit();
ECreateGame("first", 600, 300);
let Gravity = true;
let Friction = true;

            <h4>But as you see nothing is happening</h4>
            <h4>So I introduce you another command! EApplyPhysicsTo(object)</h4>
            <h4>So this command applies the physics you have just set in the config part! remmeber?</h4>
            <h4>So maybe you wanted to turn off gravity and friction, you can just don't run this command!</h4>
            <h4>So I also have to introduce another command which applies the motion of the object</h4>
            <h4>Like if you apply a lot of force and gravity and friction, Bla bla bla, you need to ALSO run this command</h4>
            <h4>or else non of them move, EApplyMotion(Object)</h4>

            <h4>So as you see there is a cube which falls and phase through the ground but we don't like that!</h4>
            <h4>So we make the ground have collision! with introducing another command: </h4>
            <h4>EApplyCollision(Dynamic Object, Static Object, Bounce Force[force right, force left, force bottom, force top])</h4>

            <h4>And yep now its time to not let the player escape the scene cause we don't see it anymore then ;c</h4>

            <br>
            <h4>EVelocityX(object) = returns the velocity in x direction of object</h4>
            <h4>EVelocityY(object) = returns the velocity in y direction of object</h4>

            <br>
            <h4>so these were the information ones now for the set ones</h4>
            <br>
            <h4>ESetVelocityX(object,value) = sets the velocity in x direction of object</h4>
            <h4>ESetVelocityY(object,value) = sets the velocity in y direction of object</h4>

            <br>
            <h4>But why do we exactly need these? well in order to not let the player escape the screen you have to teleport it back</h4>
            <h4>and teleportation means change of position not speed or velocity, and the rest might get handy for you later</h4>
            <h4>so first we have to check if the player is not colliding with the Sky then teleport so here we go:</h4>
