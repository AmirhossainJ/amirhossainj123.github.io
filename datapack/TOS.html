        <h2>
            Welcome to our terms of service or just ToS
            this is for the datapack maker thing which I made
            
            if you make a datapack that in anyway, requests money from the user, you must have the Golden version or higher of this project
            this can mean that you might make a Lifesteal Lite, and for example you want 5$ for full version which is for example Lifesteal full
            making datapacks that advertise a certain thing in the chat or something like that, in anyway you might be earning money
            you need the Datapack maker Golden version or higher!
            all the rules in License applies here too!
            making plugins and ways that might improve this project, is allowed as long as you give it to us, we will fully credit you
            else if you make your own plugin for this project, it counts as code modification and you are <NotAllowed>NOT<NotAllowed> allowed to advertise it!
            making some datapacks are <NotAllowed>NOT<NotAllowed> allowed, for example a datapack that acts like a virus(sudden insane amount of increases in the cpu/memory usage without the need counts as a virus)
            but still making datapacks for troll for example nuke the world as soon as the server started is completely allowed, but just don't make it too far(<NotAllowed>NOT<NotAllowed> against rules but still cmon man), we are <NotAllowed>NOT<NotAllowed>hing against your friendship ;D
